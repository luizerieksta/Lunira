			<p class="side-nyt">"Lunira is revolutionizing the process of euthanizing animals.  Humans have ultimately made the life or death decision for pets for as long as we can remember, but this product gives animals so much more power and control over what happens with their life – making the relationship between man and animal more moral than ever."</p>

			<img class="logo-rns" src="media/images/rns.png">
			<p class="side-rns">"The fact that animals and mankind have had different modes of communication wherein one has the ability to do so through linguistics whereas the other doesn’t, was and is God’s will. This product in trying to change the preceding fundamentally goes against God. It is blasphemous to say the least."</p>

			<p class="side-karen">"This product has helped me foster a stronger bond between me and my cat. Now I don’t have to play guess work in figuring out when she wants to sleep or what she wants to eat or if she’s feeling sick... it’s delightful!"</p>

			<p class="side-philippe">"I had such high expectations from this product… I thought it would help me understand my pet better but all it’s done is cause arguments between me and him. My intuition tells me one thing, but the product shows my dog wants another… it doesn’t make any sense. Everything is lost in translation."</p>

			<img class="logo-medical" src="media/images/medical.png">
			<p class="side-medical">"Lunira might help pet owners communicate about day to day things with pets better but when it comes to euthanizing things get trickey… pets can’t assess their health as well as our machines can so communication might turn into miscommunication… users should consider these implications before they buy Lunira."</p>
